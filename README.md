IBM OS/VS1 Release 6.0 Distribution Library Tapes
-------------------------------------------------

This is a repo that simply stores the DLIB tapes of OS/VS1 rel 6.0 as announced and made available by Kevin Leonard and (I think) Mark Waterbury. 
I did not contirbute anything to these tapes, I simply make them available to myself here so I don't have to log on to groups.io each time to download them. 

All the credit goes to the two above mentioned gentlemen. 

thanks
